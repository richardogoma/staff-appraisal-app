# Project Title: Staff Appraisal App

## Overview

The Staff Appraisal App is a canvas mobile application built using [Microsoft PowerApps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-gb/). The app enables supervisors and managers to nominate an employee in their department or unit for the staff of the month award. The app collects data on the employee, the manager's rating, the manager's justification for nominating the employee, and the employee/manager's department. The data is stored on a SharePoint list for further analysis. The app also sends automated emails to managers reminding them to nominate an employee if they haven't done so by the end of the month. The project also includes a Power BI report called **Voice of the Manager: A report from the staff nomination exercise conducted using the Staff Appraisal App** that uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques on the data collected to provide insights.

## Objectives

The objectives of this project are:

- To automate the staff of the month nomination process.
- To collect data on employee performance from managers.
- To analyze the data using NLP techniques and provide insights.
- To improve the staff of the month award process.

## Technologies Used

- Microsoft PowerApps
- Microsoft Power Automate
- SharePoint
- Microsoft Power BI

## Methodology

The Staff Appraisal App was developed using Microsoft PowerApps. The app was designed to be user-friendly, with a simple interface that allows managers to quickly nominate an employee. The app collects data on the employee, the manager's rating, the manager's justification for nominating the employee, and the employee/manager's department. The app also sends automated emails to managers reminding them to nominate an employee if they haven't done so by the end of the month.

The data collected by the app is stored on a SharePoint list, which is used as a data source for the Power BI report. The report uses NLP techniques, specifically `Keyword Extraction` and `Sentiment Analysis`, to provide insights into the data collected.

The report answers the following questions:
- What are managers saying?
- What are the manager's most dominant sentiments about their employees?
- Is there any relationship between staff ratings and the justification for their nominations?

The report is designed to be interactive, allowing users to filter the data by department, rating, and sentiment.

## Results

The Staff Appraisal App has improved the staff of the month award process by **automating the nomination process and providing a more efficient way to collect data on employee performance.** The Power BI report has provided valuable insights into the data collected, answering the questions posed by the project.

The report shows that managers are generally positive about their employees, with the most common sentiment being `positive`. The report also shows that there is a relationship between staff ratings and the justification for their nominations, with employees who are rated higher by their managers having more detailed justifications.

## Conclusion

The Staff Appraisal App has been successful in automating the staff of the month nomination process and providing valuable data on employee performance. The Power BI report has provided insights that can be used to improve the staff of the month award process. The app and report can be further developed to include additional features, such as a leaderboard of top-performing employees and feedback from employees on the nomination process.
